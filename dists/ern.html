    <p>Soaked in history and the many different grandeurs of Kerala, Ernakulam is one of the most stunning destinations in God’s Own Country! The once a capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, this township is a major commercial area in Kochi and is also called the ‘Commercial Capital of Kerala’.

      While the existence of this city dates back to the Stone Age, today it is revered to have the most electrifying ambience in the entire country. Ancient, yet with modern charm, Ernakulam also serves as a throbbing hub for budding entrepreneurs and also contributes significantly to the state’s tourism industry.</p>

                    <h4 class="card-title headcard">Fort Kochi</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Set foot into Fort Kochi and you will be instantly transported to a different time period. This place is steeped in the history and culture of all who have occupied it through the ages. Its roots and essence are unique in its diversity.

                      While walking through K. J. Herschel Road, one gets a glimpse of Fort Immanuel. This former Portuguese bastion, built in 1503, is a sign of the strategic alliance between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese Monarch. Further along the road one can see the Dutch Cemetery, housing the graves of former Colonists. People also love visiting the nearby Thakur House, a bungalow built in typical colonial era style. It now belongs to Thakur and Co., a renowned tea trading firm, but was once the residence of the officers of the National Bank of India during British rule. It was formerly called Kunal or Hill Bungalow. 
                      
                      Another delightful location is David Hall, named after David Koder who was a famous occupant of the hall. However it is more closely associated with the Dutch Commander Hendrik Adriaan van Reed tot Drakeston. He is famous for his book on the flora of Kerala, ‘Hortus Malabaricus’. One can also visit St. Francis Church, the oldest European church in India. Built in 1503, it was here that the legendary explorer Vasco-da-Gama was originally buried. The Vasco-da-Gama Square is a beautiful promenade nearby where one can go for a relaxing walk. One can drop by Pierce Leslie Bungalow to view the waterfront verandas or Koder House, a fine example of the transition from colonial to Indo-European architecture.
                      
                      Vasco House is another must visit landmark as it is said to have been the explorer’s actual residence. It is among the oldest Portuguese buildings in Kochi. A visit to the legendary Bishop House is an enriching experience. The facade of the house has large Gothic arches and the building was acquired by Dom Jos Gomes Ferreira, the 27th Bishop of the Diocese of Cochin.
                      
                      The streets, shops and the residents operate at their own pace. Time is rather abstract in Fort Kochi, and visitors will feel instantly transported into another era altogether. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Amid this picturesque island of Bolgatty is the beautiful Bolgatty Palace, the exclusive mansion with four palatial rooms, provides the travelers with world class amenities and wonderful holidaying options. Originally built by Dutch traders in 1744, it is the oldest of its kind that exists outside Holland.

                  The resort combines leisure with business and it is popularly known as the honeymooners' paradise. The resort is neatly tucked among giant umbrellas of refreshing green and is sure to give an exotic island experience in Bolgatty.

                <p class="card-text">Around two dozen kilometres from the industrial district of Ernakulam and to the side of the Vypeen Island lies every swimmer’s paradise, Cherai Beach. It is a favourite haunt of those looking for a relaxing swim with the backdrop of coconut groves being the added incentive. It provides a wonderful view of the famous Chinese Fishing Nets or Cheena Vala well. The nearby shacks provide you with fresh cuisine that fills you up perfectly after a delightful swim.

                  The seashells found here are unique and one often runs into dolphins in this area. It is the ideal blend of both the backwaters and the sea. The area itself has seen many new resorts and hotels crop up, which have facilitated the increase in tourist activity. Today it is amongst the most visited beaches in Kerala with a view that make it near impossible to tear yourself away once you get there.</p>
