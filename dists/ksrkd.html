      <p>We can say that Kasaragod is the crown of the state Kerala, Land of many differnt languages, the history of the invasion and resistance, testimonies of historical forts, remainings of innovative culture of the modern stone age like ‘Chenkallarakal’, ‘Nannangatikal’, ‘Muniyarakal’, Inscriptions of historical rulers and their practices, Lush green land of highlands of western ghat, the midlands, the unique traditions and practice of worship. Kasargod is reputed for its practice of sharing the culture and languages.

      The name Kasaragod resembles ‘a group of trees of Kanjira’. In the collection of poems of the poet Linkanna uses the term “Kasaragod” as ‘Thullu Rajaraller Malerite’. Kasaragod is no longer a group of Kanjira wood, land that is rich in lush green areca palm, coconut trees and bananas and hugged by beaches of Arabian Sea. Kasaragod is rich in history and heritage.</p>

                    <h4 class="card-title headcard">Bekal Fort</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">It is believed that the Bekal fort might have existed even from early days of the Chirakkal Rajas for the fact that it was common in those days to build a fort for the purpose of defense. Many of the old royal palaces have forts to protect them from the enemies. Decribing the Kolathiri Kingdom in his Kerala History, K.P. Padmanabha Menon writes that the residence allotted to the Thekkelamkur: "The eldest of the male members reigned as sovereign Kolathiri. The next in succession, the heir apparent, was the Thekkelamkur. The residence assigned to him was the Vadakara fort. The third in succession was the Vadakkelamkur in charge of Vekkolath fort. This V (B) ekkolath fort is identified by some scholars as the present Bekal.

                      In his Handbook of South Canara written in 1985, H.A. Stuart remarks that "Several forts were built by the Shivappa Nayak of Bednoor between 1650 and 1670. The two forts of Bekal and Chandragiri were originally under the Kolathiri or Chirakkal Rajas until the time of Shivappa Nayaka's invasion. Perhaps, the Bednore rulers might have rebuilt and improved it."
                      
                      The 'Koteyar'/'Ramakshatriya' community found in Bekal, Panayal and other places in Kasargod were said to have been brought to this land by the Nayaks to strengthen and defend the fort. There was a prolonged struggle between the Kolathiries and Nayaks to recapture and maintain their hold over this area. Following the rise of the Hyder Ali and his conquest of Bekal these prolonged battles came to an end. Thus Bekal fell into the hands of the Mysore kings.

                <p class="card-text">A beautiful rain forest near Konnakad, the Kottancheri Hills is a part of the Western Ghats in Kasaragod district and an extension of Ranipuram wildlife sanctuary. The place is 30kms north-east of Kanhangad. The picnic centre at Kottancheri Hills makes it a favorite among the travellers. The hills are also ideal for trekking and are credited as trekker’s paradise. The nearness of the Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri mountain range of Kodaku adds to the charm of this place. The Forests of Kottancherry is packed with wildlife and merges with reserved forests of Kasaragod. Wild elephants, wild dogs, deer, wild pigs, rare birds, butterflies are all abundant here. The spot resembles much of the scenic beauty of Kodiakanal.
